# SYSC-2006
This will include the code to all of the labs done in SYSC 2006
Every file in here is used to help understand how basic functionalities are designed and coded in higher level languages, python is what is mainly being referenced.

What did I learn:
I would say that I learned exactly the advantages, disadvantages, functions, complete structure of how these different basic structures work.
I also learned how C works, how everything is so level that you have to keep in mind that you must implement everything which can make simple tasks just that much longer.
After these labs, I had become so well versed in C that I started using leet code to keep up with the language so I don't get rusty using it.

Next courses that use C:
SYSC 3310, Real time Systems 
SYSC 4001, OS
